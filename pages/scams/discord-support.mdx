# Discord Support

## How it works
1. Scammers create fake Discord support accounts
2. They reach out to you claiming that they reported you or that you have been reported
3. They trick you into changing your Discord email to theirs (which steals your account)

## I've already fallen for this scam
Contact Discord support immediately and get them to change your email back.

    If you scanned a QR code, change your password. If you downloaded a file, assume it is malware and wipe your PC and change all your passwords

## How do I avoid this scam?
1. Discord Staff will NEVER DM you about issues with your account.
- Discord may send you a system message which looks like [this](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036118732-Discord-System-Messages).
2. Never share personal information or download files from untrusted sources.

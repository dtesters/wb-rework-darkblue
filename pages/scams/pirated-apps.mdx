# Free Paid Application

## How it works
1. Someone sends you a message offering you a paid application for free
2. You install the application
3. Your computer is now infected with malware

## I've already fallen for this scam
1. Wipe your PC (completely fresh install of Windows)
<Callout type="info">
    This is necessary because malware burrows itself into your system and it's hard to guarantee that you removed it.

2. Change all your passwords (yes, every single one)

## How do I avoid this scam?
- Don't install applications from untrusted sources
- If you're not sure if a source is trusted, do some research
- If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is
- Piracy is always risky. Sometimes it's worth just buying the game or software outright

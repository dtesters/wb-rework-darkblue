# NSFW Server Link

## How it works
1. Someone will send a message in a server with a link to a NSFW server
  - This can also happen in DMs
<Callout type="error">
    If your friend sends you a link, they are probably hacked! Let them know they are hacked by contacting them outside of Discord.
</Callout>
2. You join this server
3. There's a verify button and you click it
4. You scan the QR code or login to a website
5. Your account is now compromised

## I've already fallen for this scam
1. Change your password on Discord
2. Change your password on any other accounts that use the same password
3. Go to your Settings > Authorized Apps > Remove anything with the "Join servers for you" permission

## How do I avoid this scam?
- Don't click on any links that you don't trust
- Don't join servers that you don't trust
- If you're unsure, ask a friend or someone you trust to check the link for you

{<h1 className="text-center text-4xl tracking-tighter font-extrabold md:text-5xl mt-8">Rules</h1>}

## 1. Follow Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    This is a catch-all rule. We base our rules on these guidelines. Violating these rules will lead to a permanent ban. We do allow client modifications such as BetterDiscord and Vencord. You are welcome to talk about them.
</Callout>

<ChevronMenu title="1.1. You must be at least 13 years old to be on Discord" openstate={false}>
You must meet the minimum age requirement for Discord within your country. Claiming to be younger, even as a joke, will result in a ban.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="1.2. Do not use self-bots, nitro snipers, auto changing statuses, API exploits, or do anything that harms Discord’s servers" openstate={false}>
If we see that you are doing one of these, you will be banned for violating Discord’s Terms of Service.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="1.3. Do not engage or joke about organizing raids, doxxes, or swatting" openstate={false}>
Any threat or joke about raiding, doxxing, or swatting someone will result in a permanent ban. Sharing doxxing information is also considered a bannable offense, even if you are trying to make mods aware of it. When in doubt, create a ticket.

_Note: You can talk about how a server got raided or someone got mass harassed. We just ask you to not encourage the behavior._
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="1.4. Do not use Discord to scam or send malware / viruses / malicious links" openstate={false}>
Sending viruses or malware goes against Discord’s Terms of Service, and we will ban you if we find out you have sent or participated in them in or out of the server. For the sake of simplicity, IP grabbers are also not allowed.
You are allowed to discuss viruses/malware in the appropriate channels, under the condition that you do not share them, teach others how to make them, or provide resources for doing so. You are not allowed to publicly share/show the source code, or stream viruses/malware in voice chat.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="1.5 Do not leak private information" openstate={false}>
We do not allow any identifiable information to be sent to the server. This includes but is not limited to: IPs, addresses, phone numbers, legal names, or government issued IDs. Any other identifiable information is also not allowed on the server.
Giving out fake information as a joke may potentially also result in a ban.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="1.6 No Recording of Voice Channels" openstate={false}>
Recording VCs without consent is frowned upon in the server, therefore we do not allow it. We also abide by California state law, and so did you upon accepting Discord’s privacy policy. You need consent from everyone in the VC if you are going to record the VC. The only exceptions to this rule are the stages hosted by the owners, which we do allow.
</ChevronMenu>

## 2. No NSFW Content / Gore / Explicit Behavior

<ChevronMenu title="2.1. Do not talk about NSFW content" openstate={false}>
We have a zero tolerance policy for any sort of NSFW content. NSFW content is any content meant to sexualize or inflict arousal. This includes but is not limited to: jokes, memes, conversation, and pictures.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="2.2. No NSFL or gore content" openstate={false}>
NSFL (Not Safe For Life) are videos, pictures, or conversation that involves but is not limited to gore and any other topics that intend to shock or disturb members. Any discussion about these topics will result in severe punishment.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="2.3. Do not e-date or try to flirt with someone" openstate={false}>
Due to minors being on our server, we have a zero tolerance policy on e-dating and flirting. Members who try to converse or send media to other members with the intent of flirting/hitting on/rizzing up, whether a joke or not, will be punished. This also includes coming into the server with the intent of looking for people to flirt with or baiting people (“I like older men” “Any cute girls here?”).
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="2.4. Do not send any bait or cropped or suggestive NSFW content" openstate={false}>
Photos or memes that appear to look like NSFW, NSFL, or gore, are not allowed on the server (optical illusions, blurry eye trick, etc.), or in server profiles. This includes cropped pictures, blurry pictures, and vague pictures. Media with the intent of looking suggestive or implying NSFW are also not allowed.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="2.5. Do not send any form of pornography, nudity, or gore" openstate={false}>
Any form of media that contains/implies NSFW, will result in a permanent ban. If you wouldn’t send it to your grandmother, do not send it here.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="2.6. Do not sexualize minors or joke about it" openstate={false}>
We have a zero tolerance policy for any jokes, comments, or any other form of media that sexualizes a minor. This also includes if you yourself are a minor and are calling another minor hot. We have a zero tolerance policy for it, and you will be banned with no chance of appeal.
This rule also floats under Rule 2.3. If you flirt with someone and they end up being a minor, you will be banned.
</ChevronMenu>

## 3. Be Respectful to All Members

<ChevronMenu title="3.1. Do not troll, be toxic, cause arguments, or be rude to members" openstate={false}>
Causing disruptions in chat, being a nuisance to members, and generally being negative are all ways to get punished. We expect you to be respectful to other members, avoid arguments, and step away when you get angry. If you have the inability to be a kind, respectful member, you will be punished.
If you wish to argue with someone or discuss sensitive topics, please go to DMs or do not do it at all.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="3.2 Do not send death threats, be racist, sexist, or engage in hate speech" openstate={false}>
We have a zero tolerance for any sort of hate speech. This includes racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. Comments or jokes that look like hate speech will be punished accordingly. And yes, having a swastika on your profile is considered to be xenophobic and you will be banned for it.
Death threats, including telling someone to “off” themselves, will also result in punishment. This includes threats that are meant to be jokes.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="3.3 Avoid Sensitive Topics" openstate={false}>
We want to try and respect everyone’s opinions. If you do happen to talk about a sensitive topic and drama does ensue, moderative actions will be handed out.
Some examples of sensitive topics include:
- Politics
- Religion
- Sexuality
- Gender
- War
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="3.4 Do not ragebait" openstate={false}>
Intentionally asking controversial questions or responding to members with the intent to cause arguments or anger members will result in punishment. Whether a member had the intent to rage bait will be up to the discretion of moderators.
</ChevronMenu>

## 4. Do not Spam / Be a Nuisance

<ChevronMenu title="4.1. Do not Spam or Flood in VC or Chat" openstate={false}>
Spamming any sort of media, including emotes and reactions, are prohibited. Spamming also includes pinging people without a good reason, excessive posting in forum channels, and creating numerous tickets in a short period of time. 
Spamming in VC includes excessive use of soundboards, screaming into the mic, join/leaving quickly, and voice changers/TTS that irritate members.
Sending one singular message meant to fill up the chat is called flooding and is also considered as spam. Messaging chaining, where multiple members all copy and paste the same message, is also considered spamming.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="4.2. Do not be annoying" openstate={false}>
There is no cut and dry definition of annoying. If numerous people are clearly irritated and annoyed with you, you are probably the issue, and you need to find a different topic to talk about. 
Trying to cause drama, making numerous members uncomfortable, and being a general annoyance will result in punishment.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="4.3. Do not send loud/bright media" openstate={false}>
We do not allow ear-rape media or media that triggers people with photosensitivity issues.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="4.4. No Mini-Modding" openstate={false}>
Mini-modding (also known as backseat moderating) is correcting someone’s behavior when you are in fact not a moderator. 
Examples of mini-modding include:
- Threatening to punish someone for breaking the rules
- Disagreeing with moderator actions
- Actively witch hunting members in order to get them punished

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    We have a report and ticket system available for you to use if you believe someone is breaking the rules.
</Callout>
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="4.5. Do not bypass Automod" openstate={false}>
If your message gets blocked, it was because it was blocked by automod. When this happens, do not try to send your message by changing the letters of words in order to push it through (eg, retard = restarted). This is known as an automod bypass, and you will be punished for it. We have words blocked for a reason.
Yes, words known as brain rot such as sigma, skibidi, and gyatt are blocked. This was implemented due to the words being used to annoy members and lack of being used in a normal context.
</ChevronMenu>

## 5. English Only on this Server

Our server is an English-speaking server, as well as we do not have the moderation to moderate in other languages (we do not intend to ever allow other languages either, so do not ask). You will be punished if you cannot use English. Google Translate does exist if you need to use that.

## 6. Discord Profiles

<ChevronMenu title="6.1. Your Discord Profile must adhere to our rules" openstate={false}>
Discord profiles must abide by all server rules as well as Discord’s Terms of Service. Any NSFW, automodded words, racism, hate speech, sexism, transphobia, malicious content, etc. will result in you being punished. Every part of your profile is able to be moderated including, name, bio, PFP, and pronouns.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="6.2. No Impersonation" openstate={false}>
Impersonating any staff, owners, or No Text To Speech will result in a ban, joke or not.
Impersonation of select other bots/YouTubers are also subjected to be moderated at moderator discretion.
</ChevronMenu>

## 7. No Advertising

These rules apply for anyone sending a discord invite, link to their social media, or referral links to a platform.

<ChevronMenu title="7.1. Do not DM advertise" openstate={false}>
DM advertising is sending an unsolicited invitation to servers/games/links/etc to a member without a reason. DM advertisements are also against Discord’s Terms of Service and will result in a ban.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="7.2. Do not Advertise through or on the server" openstate={false}>
Sending an invite link, telling people to join your server, intentionally pointing to your status or about me that contains an advertisement is strictly prohibited. We do not allow advertising on this server.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    If someone asks for your server / social media, please DM it to them.
</Callout>
</ChevronMenu>

## 8. Do not Find Loopholes in the Rules

<b>Intentionally bending the rules and trying to find loopholes in the rules will result in moderative action.</b> Not every rule is clear-cut and perfectly defined, so avoid trying to prove otherwise.
If you feel like you have been treated unfairly by a Moderator, please report it to Lavernie. If you feel like you have been treated unfairly by an Admin+, DM No Text To Speech.
